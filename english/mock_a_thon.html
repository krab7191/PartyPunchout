                		We all know that Washington is broken:   
                		government shutdowns.. big-money influence.. 
                		extreme partisanship.. unwillingness to compromise.. 
                		politicians more loyal to their own party than to their 
                		constituents.  
                	</p>
                	<p>
                		This is your chance to make your voice heard!   
                		Join the <strong>Party Punchout Video Mock-A-Thon</strong>  and 
                		show how <strong>ridiculous</strong> things have gotten in Washington — 
                		it’s the first step toward taking our democracy back!  
                	</p>
                	<p>
                		Send us your own video pointing out a dumb action or stupid, 
                		inane statement by a politician (or other public personality).  
                		We all love our country and our democracy — but individual 
                		politicians and public figures are fair game.. so let’s point out 
                		their idiocies!  And if your video is one of the first 100 
                		uploaded, we’ll send you a Party Punchout T-shirt.

                		If you’re a professional videographer, this is a way for 
                		your work to be seen by lots of people.  Even if you’re not, 
                		it’s still a way for you to vent, get your ideas out there — 
                		and get an extremely limited edition T-shirt — one of only 100 
                		produced world-wide.

                		Here’s how: Make a video of any type: animated, live-action, — anything goes. You can dub-over or add text to, or otherwise alter, 
                		an actual news broadcast (just make sure you observe copyright laws!<a href="https://www.youtube.com/yt/copyright/" target="_blank"> https://www.youtube.com/yt/copyright/</a>). You can draw your own cartoons 
                		or do clay animation.  You can link still-shots together with captions. You can use issues in the bubbles in our game app, Party Punchout 
                		(see links at bottom of page). It can be as simple or as complex as your imagination allows. In fact, the sky’s the limit!
